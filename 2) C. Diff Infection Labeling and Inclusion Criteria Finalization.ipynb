    "## Overview\n",
    "### This notebook is designed to finalize the ICU stays for which CDI risk will be predicted, and label these patients with included cases of CDI. \n",
    "##### Key exclusion criteria:\n",
    "    Patients under age 1 - limited risk of infectious CDI and frequent diarrhea due to other causes\n",
    "    Patients with pre-existing CDI or strong suspicion prior to ICU stay (eg. diarrhea upon admission)\n",
    "    Patients without an icustay \n",
    "##### Patient Population Description:\n",
    "    Predictions will be made for each unique ICU stay, and with information gathered anytime prior to 2 days after ICU admission.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Utilizing a standard cutoff of 2 days post-ICU admission aligns with timing of other risk assessments typically made such as mortality/morbidity predictions with scales like APACHE (made around 1 days after ICU admit). As such, a tool based on this model could be implemented into existing clinical workflows.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook sections\n",
    "   #### a) Import Libraries and Key Data Import; BigQuery OAuth Setup\n",
    "    Includes import of both patient admits and ICU stays dataframes from first notebook\n",
    "   #### b) Define functions for use inside notenook\n",
    "    Date_diff - calculates difference in time between two dates\n",
    "   #### c) Label Patients With Clostridium difficile infection (CDI)\n",
    "    1) ID patients noted as having clostridium difficile infection (CDI) at any point during a hospital stay via ICD-9 code\n",
    "    2) Identify CDI with confirmed diagnosis In Microbiology Events Table\n",
    "   #### d) Finalize CDI inclusion\n",
    "    1) Must have timestamped lab diagnosis of CDI after being in the ICU for at least 2 days. This ensures minimal suspsicion or pre-existing CDI diagnosis for patients for whom CDI risk will be predicted\n",
    "   #### e) Finalize non-CDI admit inclusion\n",
    "    Largely utilizes features generated in first notebook, and also ensures patients were not discharged from hospital within 2 days after being admitted to ICU\n",
    "   #### f) Train Test Split\n",
    "    Ensures all EDA performed on training data throughout rest of notebooks\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Key Notes:\n",
    "    Standard 75%/25% train-test split\n",
    "    Split preserves entirety of each patient's data on same side of split (many have more than one hospital/ICU stay), \n",
    "    and ensures the same rate of CDI across the split.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Resulting dataframes maintain both included and excluded icustays/patients. While individual hospital or ICU stays may be excluded from risk prediction, these stays may belong to patients for whom later stays are included. Given that analysis of prior hospital care will be utilized to predict CDI during current icustays, excluded admissions are not dropped from the dataframe. Instead, excluded stays are labeled appropriately and filtered out when conducting EDA.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Output and Results\n",
    "#### Updated ICU admissions training and test dataframes (two files) with clearly marked CDI cases and inclusion/exclusion status\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary Stats:\n",
    "    Overall CDI rate of ~1.42%\n",
    "    670 out of an initial 1079 lab confirmed CDI cases remain included in final analysis based on criteria above\n",
    "    Total of 47,000 ICU stays remain included in final analysis \n",

Given that Cepheid's GeneXpert (the first FDA approved NAAT) wasn't approved until 2009, the overwhelming majority of tests here were likely done via immunoassay. Reviews of immunoassay testing (as in Menendez 2017 - see Literature Review/Diagnostics folder) suggest that when done in an algorithm, immunoassay testing achieves about 90% PPV.
